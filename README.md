# Simpliest ERC20 Equity Token There Is...
  
Create a ERC 20 token set with 0 decimal places for no division to represent whole assets like a share of stock.  

This cheap* way to create non-fungible tokens. However these are not serialized for that you need a ERC721 Non Fungible Asset.

Best for privately traded companies.  

See line 33 to set contract name  
See line 50 for long name of contract  
See line 52 for ticker symbol  
See line 53 for the relationship of decimal and issue  
See line 54 for 0 (zero) decimals making the token non-divisable  
See line 55 for total supply  

*A ERC721 Token requires individual contract execution which can get expensive.  You would not want to do that for 10M Company shares.  Please note that creating digital company assets is easy; keeping with SEC or other regulatory compliance is not.
