# Simpliest ERC20 Equity Token There Is...
  
Very simple way to create a ERC 20 token set with 0 decimal places for no division.  
This cheap way to create non-fungible tokens to represent whole assests like a share of stock.  
Best or privately traded companies.

See line 53 for the relationship of decimal and issue  
See line 54 for 0 (zero) decimals making the token non-divisable  
See line 55 for total supply
